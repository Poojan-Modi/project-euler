# Project Euler Solutions in C++

This repository contains my solutions to [Project Euler](httpss using C++.
I'm using this project to improve my algorithmic thinking and C++ skills as part of my journey into robotics and embedded systems.

## Structure

- Each problem is stored in the `problems/` folder.
- Solutions are named `problem_XXXX.cpp` where `XXXX` is the problem number.
- You can compile any file using `g++` or your preferred build system.

## How to Compile

```bash
g++ problems/problem_001.cpp -o build/problem_001
./build/problem_001
