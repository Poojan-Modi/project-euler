/*
Problem 7: 10,001st Prime
    By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

Task
    What is the 10,001st prime number?

Solution:
    1 is not a prime.
    All primes except 2 are odd.
    All primes greater than 3 can be written in the form 6k+/-1.
    Any number n can have only one primefactor greater than n .
    The consequence for primality testing of a number n is: if we cannot find a number f less than
    or equal n that divides n then n is prime: the only primefactor of n is n itself

Code Complexity:
    Time: O(nâˆšn)
    Space: O(1)
